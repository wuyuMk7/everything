About project 2:

Collaborated with Jessica Zhang and Frank Wang.

My task is to enable the Raspberry PI to retrieve data from load cells and force sensitive resistors, and send the data to the remote server. 

I am also responsible for creating an application based on Google Assistant in order that users can interact with our system using Google Assistant or smart speakers.
